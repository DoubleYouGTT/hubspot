To know how to get your Hubspot API key, refer to [the corresponding section of Hubspot API docs](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/integrations/how-do-i-get-my-hubspot-api-key). Hubspot recommends you to re-generate your API key every six months.

The API key should be set using the `hubspot_key_set()` function, that relies on the `keyring` package that stores the key in the system default credential store (see `keyring` docs).

```r
# Either input the key as parameter
hubspot_key_set("yourapikey")

# Or just call the function,
# the key will be asked interactively
hubspot_key_set()
```

If no API key is set, the "demo" key is used and a message is printed to the screen. As noted earlier, this won't give you access to your own Hubspot data.

You can check the daily usage related to the API key via `hubspot_api_usage()`. Calls in the package are rate limited (100 requests every 10 seconds) but there's also a daily limit on calls.

```r
hubspot_api_usage()
```

**For a more secure authorization method, without a daily limit on calls, see [`hubspot_token_get()`].**
